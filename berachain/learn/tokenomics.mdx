## The Three-Token System

Berachain operates with three native tokens, each serving a specific purpose in the ecosystem:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="BERA" icon="gas-pump">
    Gas & Utility Token
  </Card>
  <Card title="BGT" icon="landmark">
    Governance Token
  </Card>
  <Card title="HONEY" icon="coins">
    Native Stablecoin
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## BERA Token

### Purpose

BERA is the native gas token used for:
- Paying transaction fees
- Validator operations
- General utility in the ecosystem

### Properties

- **Supply**: Uncapped (inflationary)
- **Distribution**: Block rewards to validators
- **Transferable**: Yes, freely tradable
- **Burnable**: Can be minted by burning BGT 1:1

### BERA Economics

```
Block Reward: ~X BERA per block
Annual Inflation: ~Y%
Validators receive BERA as block rewards
```

<Note>
  BERA can be obtained by burning BGT, providing a one-way conversion mechanism.
</Note>

## BGT Token (Berachain Governance Token)

### Purpose

BGT is the governance token used for:
- Protocol governance and voting
- Validator delegation
- Directing liquidity incentives
- Participating in Proof-of-Liquidity

### Properties

- **Supply**: Dynamic (minted through PoL)
- **Non-Transferable**: Cannot be sold or transferred
- **Earned Only**: Must be earned through ecosystem participation
- **Burnable**: Can be burned 1:1 to mint BERA

### How to Earn BGT

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide Liquidity">
    Supply liquidity to whitelisted pools on BEX or Bend
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive Emissions">
    Validators direct BGT emissions to liquidity providers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delegate or Burn">
    Delegate BGT to validators or burn for BERA
  </Step>
</Steps>

### BGT Utility

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Governance Voting">
    Vote on protocol proposals, parameter changes, and ecosystem initiatives
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Validator Delegation">
    Delegate to validators to earn rewards and influence block production
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Gauge Voting">
    Vote on which pools receive BGT emissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Burn for BERA">
    Convert to liquid BERA at 1:1 ratio (irreversible)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### BGT Distribution

```
Total BGT Emissions: ~Z BGT per block

Distribution:
- 70% to Liquidity Providers (via validators)
- 20% to Protocol Treasury
- 10% to Ecosystem Development
```

<Warning>
  BGT cannot be purchased - it can only be earned through ecosystem participation. This ensures aligned incentives.
</Warning>

## HONEY Token

### Purpose

HONEY is Berachain's native overcollateralized stablecoin:
- Medium of exchange
- Unit of account
- Collateral in DeFi protocols
- Stable value storage

### Properties

- **Peg**: $1 USD
- **Collateralization**: 110-150% (variable)
- **Backing**: Multi-asset collateral
- **Transferable**: Yes, freely tradable

### HONEY Mechanics

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
    Users deposit approved assets (BERA, wETH, wBTC, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Mint HONEY">
    Mint HONEY against collateral (min 110% ratio)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use HONEY">
    Trade, lend, or use in DeFi applications
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Burn to Redeem">
    Burn HONEY to reclaim collateral
  </Step>
</Steps>

### HONEY Stability Mechanisms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Overcollateralization">
    All HONEY is backed by 110-150% collateral value, ensuring solvency even during price drops.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Liquidations">
    Positions below minimum collateral ratio are liquidated to maintain system health.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Stability Pool">
    HONEY holders can deposit in stability pool to earn rewards and support peg.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Redemption Mechanism">
    HONEY can always be redeemed for $1 worth of collateral, creating price floor.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Token Interactions

### BERA ↔ BGT

```
BGT → BERA: Burn BGT to mint BERA (1:1)
BERA → BGT: Cannot directly convert (must earn through PoL)
```

### HONEY Minting

```
Collateral → HONEY: Deposit collateral, mint HONEY
HONEY → Collateral: Burn HONEY, redeem collateral
```

## Economic Flywheel

The three-token system creates a powerful flywheel effect:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Liquidity Provision">
    Users provide liquidity to earn BGT
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="BGT Accumulation">
    Validators attract liquidity by offering competitive BGT rewards
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Network Security">
    More BGT delegation = stronger validator = better network security
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="BERA Demand">
    Users burn BGT for BERA to pay gas, creating BERA demand
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="HONEY Utility">
    HONEY facilitates stable transactions and DeFi activities
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supply Dynamics

### BERA Supply

```
Initial Supply: X BERA
Inflation: ~Y% annually
Sources: Block rewards
Sinks: Gas fees (burned), ecosystem growth
```

### BGT Supply

```
Initial Supply: 0 BGT (all earned)
Emission Rate: ~Z BGT per block
Sources: PoL emissions
Sinks: Burned for BERA
```

### HONEY Supply

```
Supply: Demand-driven (minted as needed)
Backing: 110-150% collateralized
Max Supply: Unlimited (market-driven)
```

## Comparison with Other L1s

| Feature | Berachain | Ethereum | Solana |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Gas Token | BERA | ETH | SOL |
| Governance | BGT (non-transferable) | Token-based | Token-based |
| Stablecoin | HONEY (native) | USDC (external) | USDC (external) |
| Consensus | PoL | PoS | PoS |
| Incentive Alignment | High | Medium | Medium |

## Token Distribution

### Genesis Distribution

```
Total Initial BERA:
- 40% Ecosystem Development
- 25% Team & Advisors (4-year vest)
- 20% Community Treasury
- 15% Public Sale

BGT: 100% earned through participation (no genesis distribution)
HONEY: Minted on-demand by users
```

## Staking & Delegation

### BERA Staking

Not directly stakeable - instead, provide liquidity to earn BGT

### BGT Delegation

```
Delegate BGT to validators:
- Earn additional rewards
- Influence network governance
- Support preferred validators
- No lockup period
```

## Use Cases

### For Traders

- Trade with BERA
- Use HONEY for stable value
- Provide liquidity to earn BGT

### For Liquidity Providers

- Earn BGT emissions
- Compound yields through delegation
- Participate in governance

### For Validators

- Earn BERA block rewards
- Attract liquidity with BGT
- Build ecosystem services

### For Builders

- Use HONEY as stable payment rails
- Integrate BGT incentives
- Build on liquid infrastructure
