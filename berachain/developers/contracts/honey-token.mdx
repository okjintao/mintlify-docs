**Inherits:**
ERC20, AccessControlUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable, IHoneyErrors

## State Variables

### factory

The factory contract address that has exclusive permission to mint and burn Honey.

```solidity
address public factory;
```

## View Functions

### name

Returns the name of the token: "Honey"

```solidity
function name() public pure override returns (string memory);
```

### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token: "HONEY"

```solidity
function symbol() public pure override returns (string memory);
```

## Functions

### initialize

Initializes the contract with governance and factory addresses. Can only be called once.

**Access:** Only during deployment
**Errors:**

- `ZeroAddress`: If either `_governance` or `_factory` is the zero address

```solidity
function initialize(address _governance, address _factory) external initializer;
```

### mint

Mints Honey tokens to a specified address.

**Access:** Only HoneyFactory
**Errors:**

- `NotFactory`: If called by any address other than the factory

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyFactory;
```

### burn

Burns Honey tokens from a specified address.

**Access:** Only HoneyFactory
**Errors:**

- `NotFactory`: If called by any address other than the factory

```solidity
function burn(address from, uint256 amount) external onlyFactory;
```

## Events

### Transfer

Emitted when tokens are transferred between accounts.

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
```

### Approval

Emitted when an account approves another account to spend tokens on their behalf.

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
```

## Errors

### ZeroAddress

```solidity
error ZeroAddress();
```

Thrown when attempting to initialize with a zero address.

### NotFactory

```solidity
error NotFactory();
```

Thrown when a restricted function is called by an address other than the factory.

### Other Errors

The contract inherits additional errors from IHoneyErrors that may be relevant in the broader system context.
