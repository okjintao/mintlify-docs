## Components

Berachain is a high-performance EVM-identical Layer 1 blockchain. Before you start building, it's important to understand the key components and how they work together.

* **EVM Identical Runtime**: Berachain's execution environment is identical to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as seen on Ethereum Mainnet. Deploy your existing Ethereum smart contracts without modifications and use familiar tools like Hardhat, Foundry, and Remix.

* **Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL)**: A novel economic mechanism that prioritizes users and applications over validator rewards. Network incentives go towards enriching ecosystem liquidity, contributing to efficient trading, price stability, securing the chain, and increasing network growth.

* **BeaconKit Framework**: A modular consensus layer framework that enables single slot finality, optimistic payload building, and full EIP compatibility. Built on CometBFT consensus for increased composability.

* **Native DeFi Stack**: Built-in protocols including BEX (DEX) and Bend (Lending) that are deeply integrated into the chain's infrastructure and serve as reference implementations.

## Getting Started

The following section will walk you through the sequence of steps to start building on Berachain.

### 1

**Learn the fundamentals**

Understand Berachain's architecture, Proof-of-Liquidity mechanism, and how it differs from other blockchains.

### 2

**Set up your development environment**

Install Foundry or your preferred development tooling. Berachain supports all standard EVM tooling.

### 3

**Deploy your first contract**

Follow the developer quickstart guide to deploy an ERC-20 token or your first smart contract to Berachain testnet.

### 4

**Connect to native protocols**

Integrate with BEX for trading and liquidity, or Bend for lending and borrowing to leverage Berachain's native DeFi stack.

### 5

**Explore advanced features**

Learn how to leverage Proof-of-Liquidity in your applications and take advantage of single slot finality.

## Next Steps

Of course there is a lot more to explore. Take a look at some of the guides and resources to get an idea of what you can build:
