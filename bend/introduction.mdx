| wETH | 80% | 85% | 5% |

## Safety Features

### Health Factor

Your position's safety is measured by the health factor:

```
Health Factor = (Collateral × Liquidation Threshold) / Borrowed Amount

> 1.0 = Healthy
< 1.0 = Subject to liquidation
```

<Warning>
  Always maintain a health factor above 1.2 to avoid liquidation during market volatility.
</Warning>

New or volatile assets are isolated:

- Can only borrow stablecoins

- Cannot be combined with other collateral

### Oracle Protection

- Multiple oracle sources (Chainlink, BEX TWAP)
