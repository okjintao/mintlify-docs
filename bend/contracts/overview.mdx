## Core Contracts

Bend's lending protocol consists of multiple interconnected smart contracts.

### LendingPool

The main contract for all lending and borrowing operations.

**Address (Mainnet)**: `0x...` (Coming Soon)

**Key Functions:**
- `supply()` - Deposit assets to earn interest
- `borrow()` - Borrow assets against collateral
- `repay()` - Repay borrowed assets
- `withdraw()` - Withdraw supplied assets
- `liquidationCall()` - Liquidate undercollateralized positions

### LendingPoolAddressesProvider

Registry of all protocol addresses.

**Address (Testnet)**: `0x...` (Coming Soon)

**Key Functions:**
- `getLendingPool()` - Get lending pool address
- `getPriceOracle()` - Get oracle address
- `getLendingRateOracle()` - Get rate oracle address

### AToken

Interest-bearing token received when supplying assets.

**Contracts:**
- `aHONEY` - Represents supplied HONEY
- `aBERA` - Represents supplied BERA
- `awETH` - Represents supplied wETH
- `awBTC` - Represents supplied wBTC

**Key Functions:**
- `balanceOf()` - Get balance (increases with interest)
- `transfer()` - Transfer aTokens
- `approve()` - Approve aToken spending

### Price Oracle

Provides asset price feeds for the protocol.

**Address (Testnet)**: `0x...` (Coming Soon)

**Sources:**
- Chainlink price feeds
- BEX TWAP oracle
- Fallback oracles

## Interest Rate Models

Bend uses dynamic interest rate models based on utilization:

### Standard Model

```
Base Rate: 0%
Optimal Utilization: 80%
Slope1: 4%
Slope2: 75%

Interest Rate = Base + (Utilization / Optimal) × Slope1
                (if under optimal)
               or
               Base + Slope1 + ((Utilization - Optimal) / (100 - Optimal)) × Slope2
                (if over optimal)
```

### Stablecoin Model

More gradual rate curve for stablecoins:

```
Base Rate: 0%
Optimal Utilization: 90%
Slope1: 4%
Slope2: 60%
```

## Security
