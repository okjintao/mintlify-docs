</Warning>

## Understanding Collateral

### Loan-to-Value (LTV)

LTV determines how much you can borrow against your collateral:

| Asset | Max LTV | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| BERA | 75% | $1000 BERA → Borrow up to $750 |
| wETH | 80% | $1000 wETH → Borrow up to $800 |
| wBTC | 70% | $1000 wBTC → Borrow up to $700 |
| HONEY | 85% | $1000 HONEY → Borrow up to $850 |
| LP Tokens | 60% | $1000 LP → Borrow up to $600 |

### Liquidation Threshold

The point at which your position can be liquidated:

```
Liquidation Threshold = LTV + Safety Buffer

BERA Example:
- Max LTV: 75%
- Liquidation Threshold: 80%
- Safety Buffer: 5%
```

<Tip>
  Keep your borrowed amount well below the liquidation threshold to account for price volatility.
</Tip>

### Health Factor

Your position's safety is measured by the health factor:

```
Health Factor = (Collateral Value × Liquidation Threshold) / Borrowed Value

Example:
- Collateral: $10,000 BERA (80% threshold)
- Borrowed: $6,000 HONEY
- Health Factor = ($10,000 × 0.80) / $6,000 = 1.33

Status: ✓ Safe (above 1.0)
```

#### Health Factor Thresholds

<Check>**> 1.5**: Very Safe - Comfortable margin</Check>
<Check>**1.2 - 1.5**: Safe - Monitor regularly</Check>
<Warning>**1.0 - 1.2**: Caution - Consider adding collateral</Warning>
<Warning>**< 1.0**: Danger - Subject to liquidation</Warning>

## Borrowing Strategies

### Strategy 1: Leverage Trading

Amplify your position in an asset:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Supply Collateral">
    Supply 10 BERA ($20,000)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Borrow Stablecoin">
    Borrow $12,000 HONEY (60% LTV - conservative)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Buy More BERA">
    Use borrowed HONEY to buy 6 more BERA
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Result">
    You now have 16 BERA exposure with 10 BERA collateral
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Risk**: If BERA price drops 25%, health factor approaches liquidation
**Reward**: If BERA rises 50%, your gains are amplified

### Strategy 2: Yield Farming

Borrow to deploy in high-yield opportunities:

```
1. Supply $10,000 wBTC as collateral
2. Borrow $5,000 HONEY (50% LTV)
3. Provide HONEY liquidity on BEX
4. Earn trading fees + BGT (30% APY)
5. Pay borrow cost (12% APR)
6. Net gain: ~18% APY + maintain wBTC exposure
```

### Strategy 3: Liquidity Without Selling

Access cash while holding long-term:

```
Scenario: Need $5000 but don't want to sell your BERA

Solution:
1. Supply 5 BERA ($10,000) as collateral
2. Borrow $5,000 HONEY
3. Withdraw HONEY to fiat or use in DeFi
4. Maintain BERA exposure for future appreciation
```

### Strategy 4: Arbitrage

Take advantage of rate differences:

```
If Bend borrow rate < DeFi lending rate:
1. Borrow HONEY on Bend @ 8% APR
2. Lend HONEY elsewhere @ 12% APY
3. Profit: 4% spread (minus gas)
```

## Managing Borrow Positions

### Monitoring Your Position

Key metrics to watch:

| Metric | Target | Action If... |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Health Factor | > 1.5 | < 1.3: Add collateral or repay |
| Borrow APR | Low as possible | High: Consider repaying |
| Collateral Price | Stable/Rising | Falling: Monitor closely |
| Borrowed Amount | < 70% of max | > 80%: Reduce risk |

### Adding More Collateral

To improve your health factor:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Dashboard">
    Navigate to your position in the dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Supply More">
    Supply additional collateral assets
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Health Factor Increases">
    Your health factor automatically improves
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Repaying Borrowed Assets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Borrowed Asset">
    Find the asset you borrowed in your dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Repay">
    Enter the amount to repay (or click "Max")
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Transaction">
    Approve and confirm the repayment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Collateral Released">
    As you repay, more collateral becomes available to withdraw
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  You must repay borrowed assets plus accrued interest. The interface shows the total amount due.
</Note>

## Borrowing Costs

### Interest Rates

Borrow rates are determined by utilization:

```
Low Utilization (< 70%):
- Borrow APR: 3-8%

Optimal Utilization (70-80%):
- Borrow APR: 8-15%

High Utilization (> 80%):
- Borrow APR: 15-30% (discourages borrowing)
```

### Example Cost Calculation

```
Scenario:
- Borrow: $10,000 HONEY
- APR: 10%
- Time: 30 days

Interest Cost = $10,000 × 0.10 × (30/365)
             = $82.19

Total to repay after 30 days: $10,082.19
```

### Rate Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Variable Rate (Default)">
    Changes based on market utilization. Most common and typically lower rates.
    
    **Pros**: Usually lower rates, no commitment
    **Cons**: Unpredictable, can spike during high demand
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Stable Rate">
    Fixed rate for a period, with periodic rebalancing.
    
    **Pros**: Predictable costs, protection from rate spikes
    **Cons**: Usually higher than variable, less flexible
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Liquidations

### What is Liquidation?

When your health factor drops below 1.0, liquidators can repay your debt and seize your collateral:

```
Liquidation Process:
1. Health factor < 1.0
2. Liquidator repays portion of your debt
3. Liquidator receives your collateral + liquidation bonus
4. You lose collateral but debt is reduced
```

### Liquidation Example

```
Your Position:
- Collateral: 10 BERA @ $2,000 = $20,000
- Borrowed: $15,000 HONEY
- Health Factor: 1.07 (barely safe)

BERA Price Drops to $1,800:
- Collateral Value: $18,000
- Borrowed: $15,000
- Health Factor: 0.96 (< 1.0)
- Status: Liquidatable!

Liquidator Actions:
- Repays: $7,500 HONEY (50% max)
- Receives: $7,875 worth of BERA (includes 5% penalty)

Your Position After:
- Collateral: ~5.62 BERA remaining
- Borrowed: $7,500 HONEY remaining
- Lost: 4.38 BERA to liquidation
```

### Avoiding Liquidation

<Check>**Maintain High Health Factor**: Keep > 1.5</Check>
<Check>**Set Price Alerts**: Monitor collateral asset prices</Check>
<Check>**Keep Reserve Funds**: Ready to add collateral quickly</Check>
<Check>**Use Conservative LTV**: Borrow less than maximum</Check>
<Check>**Diversify Collateral**: Use multiple assets to reduce volatility</Check>

### Recovery from Near-Liquidation

If your health factor is < 1.2:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Act Quickly">
    Time is critical - market moves fast
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Option 1: Add Collateral">
    Supply more collateral (fastest option)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Option 2: Repay Debt">
    Repay some or all borrowed amount
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Option 3: Combination">
    Add collateral AND repay for maximum safety
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Features

### E-Mode (Efficiency Mode)

Borrow correlated assets at higher LTV:

```
Example: HONEY/USDC E-Mode
- Normal LTV: 75%
- E-Mode LTV: 90%
- Requirement: Only borrow stablecoins

Benefits:
- More capital efficient
- Lower borrow rates
- Better suited for stablecoin strategies
```

### Flash Loans

Borrow without collateral for single-transaction operations:

```javascript
// Conceptual example
1. Flash borrow 100 BERA
2. Perform arbitrage trade
3. Repay 100 BERA + 0.09% fee
4. Keep profit

All in one transaction - if unprofitable, reverts automatically
```

<Note>
  Flash loans require smart contract knowledge and are for advanced users only.
</Note>

### Delegated Borrowing

Allow others to borrow using your collateral (with limits):

```
Use Case: Trust setup or managed accounts
- Set borrowing limit
- Specify allowed assets
- Revoke anytime
```

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing

Never borrow the maximum amount:

```
Recommended Borrowing Limits:

Conservative: Max 50% of available
Moderate: Max 65% of available
Aggressive: Max 75% of available

Never: 100% of available (instant liquidation risk)
```

### Collateral Diversification

Spread risk across multiple assets:

```
Example Portfolio:
- 40% wETH collateral
- 30% BERA collateral
- 20% wBTC collateral
- 10% Stable collateral

Benefits:
- Reduces impact of single asset price drop
- More stable health factor
- Better liquidation protection
```

### Stop-Loss Strategy

Set mental stop-losses to manage risk:

```
Example Rules:
- If collateral drops 15%: Add more collateral
- If collateral drops 25%: Repay 50% of debt
- If collateral drops 35%: Close entire position
```
