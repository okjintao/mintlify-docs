## Getting Started with Lending

Lending on Bend allows you to earn passive income on your crypto assets through:

- **Interest**: Paid by borrowers
- **BGT Emissions**: From Proof-of-Liquidity
- **Additional Rewards**: From incentive programs

<Tip>
  Lending on Bend is one of the safest ways to earn yield in DeFi while contributing to ecosystem liquidity.

## Understanding Lending Rates

### Supply APY

Your earnings come from two sources:

```
Total APY = Base APY + BGT APR

Example for HONEY lending:
- Base APY: 8% (from borrower interest)
- BGT APR: 15% (from PoL emissions)
- Total APY: 23%
```

### Rate Determinants

Interest rates are dynamically calculated based on:

1. **Utilization Rate**: Percentage of supplied assets that are borrowed
2. **Target Utilization**: Optimal utilization for each market
3. **Rate Curve**: Interest rate model parameters

<Note>
  Higher utilization = Higher APY for lenders (and higher APR for borrowers)
</Note>

### Utilization Example

```
Market: HONEY Lending Pool
Total Supplied: 1,000,000 HONEY
Total Borrowed: 700,000 HONEY
Utilization: 70%

At 70% utilization:
- Supply APY: ~8%
- Borrow APR: ~12%
```

## Choosing Assets to Lend

### Stablecoins (HONEY, USDC)

**Pros:**
- Minimal price volatility
- Steady, predictable returns
- Lower risk profile

**Cons:**
- Generally lower APY
- No price appreciation

**Best for**: Conservative investors, stable income

### Major Cryptocurrencies (BERA, wETH, wBTC)

**Pros:**
- Competitive APY
- Price appreciation potential
- High liquidity

**Cons:**
- Price volatility risk
- May have lower utilization

**Best for**: Moderate risk tolerance, long-term holders

### LP Tokens

**Pros:**
- Triple yield (fees + BGT + lending interest)
- High APY potential
- Compounding rewards

**Cons:**
- Complex risk (impermanent loss + lending risk)
- Lower liquidity
- Requires understanding of LP mechanics

**Best for**: Advanced users, yield maximizers

## Receipt Tokens (bTokens)

When you supply assets, you receive bTokens:

```
Supply 100 HONEY → Receive 100 bHONEY
```

### bToken Properties

- **1:1 Initial Rate**: Start at 1:1 with underlying asset
- **Appreciation**: Value increases as interest accrues
- **Transferable**: Can send to other wallets
- **Redeemable**: Burn to receive underlying + interest
- **Composable**: Use in other DeFi protocols

<Warning>
  bTokens are proof of your deposit. Keep them safe! Losing bTokens = losing your deposited funds.
</Warning>

### Using bTokens

bTokens can be:

1. **Held**: Simply hold to earn interest
2. **Used as Collateral**: Enable as collateral to borrow
3. **Traded**: Swap for other assets (may have slippage)
4. **Staked**: Stake in additional yield farms

## Earning BGT Rewards

### How BGT is Distributed

BGT rewards are distributed to lenders based on:

1. **Market Weight**: How much BGT is allocated to each market
2. **Your Share**: Your percentage of total supply in the market
3. **Time**: Rewards accrue per block

### Calculating Your BGT

```
Your Daily BGT = (Your Supply / Total Supply) × Market Daily BGT × Time

Example:
- You supply: 10,000 HONEY
- Market total: 1,000,000 HONEY (1% share)
- Market daily BGT: 1,000 BGT
- Your daily BGT: 10 BGT
```

### Claiming BGT

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Rewards">
    Go to the "Rewards" section in your Bend dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View Claimable BGT">
    See your accumulated BGT rewards across all markets
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Claim">
    Click "Claim All" and confirm the transaction
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Claim BGT regularly to delegate to validators or burn for BERA, but consider gas costs vs reward amount.
</Tip>

## Withdrawal Process

### How to Withdraw

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Your Supplies">
    Navigate to your dashboard and find the asset you want to withdraw
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Available">
    Verify available liquidity in the market (not all supplied funds may be available if borrowed)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Enter withdrawal amount (or click "Max" for everything)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the transaction. You'll receive your supplied amount plus accrued interest.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Withdrawal Limits

You can only withdraw up to:

```
Available to Withdraw = Your Supply - Used as Collateral - Borrowed Funds
```

<Warning>
  If funds are being used as collateral, you must reduce your borrowed amount or add more collateral before withdrawing.
</Warning>

### When Liquidity is Low

If utilization is too high (>90%), you may need to wait:

```
Market Utilization: 95%
Available for Withdrawal: Only 5% of your supply

Options:
1. Wait for borrowers to repay
2. Withdraw available portion
3. Enable as collateral and borrow instead
```

## Lending Strategies

### Conservative Strategy

Focus on stability and safety:

```
Portfolio Allocation:
- 60% HONEY (stablecoin)
- 25% wETH (major crypto)
- 15% BERA (native token)

Expected APY: 10-15%
Risk Level: Low
```

### Moderate Strategy

Balance risk and reward:

```
Portfolio Allocation:
- 40% HONEY
- 30% wBTC
- 20% BERA
- 10% High-yield alt tokens

Expected APY: 20-30%
Risk Level: Medium
```

### Aggressive Strategy

Maximize yields with higher risk:

```
Portfolio Allocation:
- 30% LP Tokens
- 30% High-yield alts
- 20% BERA
- 20% Stablecoins (safety buffer)

Expected APY: 40-60%
Risk Level: High
```

</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Oracle Risk**: Price feed manipulation could affect protocol (mitigated by multiple oracles)
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Depeg Risk**: Stablecoins losing peg value (monitor HONEY health)
</Warning>

### Safety Measures

<Check>**Start Small**: Test with small amounts before committing large capital</Check>
<Check>**Diversify**: Spread across multiple assets and markets</Check>
<Check>**Monitor Regularly**: Check positions and rates weekly</Check>
<Check>**Keep Exit Liquidity**: Don't lock up all capital; maintain reserves</Check>
<Check>**Understand bTokens**: Know that bTokens represent your claim</Check>

## Advanced Features

### Auto-Compounding

Enable automatic reinvestment of earnings:

```javascript
// Automatically compounds interest back into supply
- Claim BGT → Swap to underlying → Re-supply
- Frequency: Daily/Weekly
- Gas costs: ~$0.05 per compound
```

### Supply Multiple Assets

Diversify by lending multiple assets simultaneously:

```
Portfolio:
✓ 10,000 HONEY @ 8% APY
✓ 1 wBTC @ 5% APY + 12% BGT
✓ 50 BERA @ 6% APY + 15% BGT
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I lose my supplied assets?">
    Your supplied assets are generally safe. The main risks are smart contract exploits (mitigated by audits) and inability to withdraw if utilization is 100% (temporary).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How often does interest compound?">
    Interest accrues every block (~5 seconds) and automatically compounds into your supply.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens to my supply if I don't claim BGT?">
    BGT continues to accrue and can be claimed anytime. No expiration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I withdraw more than I supplied?">
    Yes! You withdraw your original supply plus all accrued interest.
  </Accordion>
