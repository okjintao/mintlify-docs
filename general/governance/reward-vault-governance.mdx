# Reward Vault Governance

While creating a [Reward Vault](/general/proof-of-liquidity/reward-vaults) is permissionless, they must be whitelisted through governance proposals to receive `$BGT` emissions from validators. This process ensures community oversight and alignment over projects joining the Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) ecosystem.

## Request for Reward Vault

<Tip>
The Reward Vault whitelisting process involves 1) submitting a **Request for Reward Vault** (RFRV) form **AND** 2) posting on the [Governance Forum](https://hub.forum.berachain.com/c/reward-vaults/6).
</Tip>

There are two types of RFRVs - ensure you complete the appropriate form based on your use case: **BEX Pool RFRVs** (For token pairs trading on BEX) and **General (non-BEX) RFRVs** (For other protocol integrations).

### 1. BEX Pool RFRVs

[Submit BEX Pool RFRV Form](https://tinyurl.com/bdebbjkb)

**Requirements:**

- Pool must be live on BEX
- Incentive tokens must be active on BEX pool
- Recommended to pair with major tokens (BERA, HONEY, BYUSD, USDC, wETH, wBTC)
- Demonstrate economic value through TVL or trading volume
- Meet security and decentralization criteria

### 2. General (non-BEX) RFRVs

[Submit General RFRV Form](https://tinyurl.com/3kzv8de7)

**Requirements:**

- Contract must be deployed and live
- Incentive tokens must be live
- Demonstrate economic value and ecosystem synergy

Proposals are reviewed weekly (deadline Thursday 00:00 UTC) by the BGT Foundation and Guardians.
