Blockchain wallets allow you, and only you, to access your assets on Berachain. Wallets enable this by allowing you to create and store your private keys, which can then be used to prove that you can access the assets in the wallet to do things such as trade tokens, buy NFTs, play games, and more.

## How To Set Up A MetaMask Wallet With Berachain

**NOTE:** It is recommended that you set this up through Chrome.

This will ask you to first set a password. This is the password you will enter when you open up the MetaMask extension:

Next, follow the instructions to secure your wallet phrase. This step is very important as the wallet phrase is what is used to prove that you own the assets in your wallet.
