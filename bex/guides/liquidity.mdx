## What is Liquidity Providing?

Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit tokens into BEX pools, enabling traders to swap tokens. In return, LPs earn:

- **Trading fees** from every swap
- **BGT emissions** through Proof-of-Liquidity
- **Additional rewards** from incentive programs

<Tip>
  Providing liquidity on BEX is one of the best ways to earn BGT tokens and participate in Berachain governance.
</Tip>

## How to Provide Liquidity

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Pool">
    Navigate to the "Pools" section on BEX and select a pool to provide liquidity to
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Requirements">
    Review the pool's token ratio and required amounts. You'll need both tokens in the correct proportion.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Amounts">
    Enter the amount of one token, and the interface will automatically calculate the required amount of the other token.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Approve Tokens">
    Approve BEX to spend your tokens (one-time approval per token)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Liquidity">
    Confirm the transaction and receive LP tokens representing your pool share
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding LP Tokens

When you provide liquidity, you receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens that represent:

- Your share of the pool
- Your claim to trading fees
- Your eligibility for BGT rewards

<Note>
  LP tokens can be staked, transferred, or used as collateral in other DeFi protocols (with care).
</Note>

## Earning Rewards

### Trading Fees

Earn a share of every trade proportional to your pool share:

```
Your Fee Earnings = (Your LP Tokens / Total LP Tokens) × Trading Fees
```

Example:
- Pool has $1M total liquidity
- You provide $10K (1% of pool)
- Pool generates $1000 in daily fees
- You earn $10/day in fees (1% of $1000)

### BGT Emissions

Through Proof-of-Liquidity, LPs earn BGT based on:

1. **Pool Weight**: How much BGT is allocated to your pool
2. **Your Share**: Your percentage of the pool
3. **Validator**: Which validator directs BGT to the pool

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="High APR Pools" icon="arrow-trend-up">
    New or incentivized pools with high BGT emissions (20-100%+ APR)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stable Pools" icon="chart-line">
    Established pools with steady, lower APRs (5-20%)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Pool Types

### Standard Constant Product Pools (50/50)

Most common pool type with equal value of both tokens:

```
Pool Composition:
- 50% Token A
- 50% Token B

Example: $1000 BERA + $1000 HONEY
```

**Best for**: Most trading pairs with moderate volatility

### Stable Pools

Optimized for assets with similar values:

```
Examples:
- HONEY/USDC
- USDT/USDC
- wETH/stETH
```

**Advantages**:
- Minimal impermanent loss
- Lower fees but higher volume
- More capital efficient

### Weighted Pools

Multi-token pools with custom weights:

```
Example:
- 50% BERA
- 25% wETH
- 25% wBTC
```

**Best for**: Index tokens and diversified exposure

### Concentrated Liquidity

Provide liquidity in specific price ranges for maximum capital efficiency:

```
Example:
- HONEY/USDC in range $0.98 - $1.02
- 10x more capital efficient than full-range
```

<Warning>
  Concentrated liquidity requires active management and has higher impermanent loss risk if price moves outside your range.
</Warning>

## Understanding Impermanent Loss

Impermanent loss occurs when the price ratio of your deposited tokens changes:

### Example Scenario

```
Initial Deposit:
- 1 ETH @ $2000 = $2000
- 2000 HONEY @ $1 = $2000
- Total Value: $4000

Price Changes:
- ETH rises to $3000
- HONEY stays at $1

If you held: $3000 + $2000 = $5000
Pool value: ~$4900
Impermanent Loss: ~2%
```

<Note>
  Trading fees and BGT rewards often offset impermanent loss, especially in high-volume pools.
</Note>

### Minimizing Impermanent Loss

1. **Choose stable pairs**: Like HONEY/USDC
2. **Use concentrated liquidity**: Set tight ranges for stablecoins
3. **Focus on high-fee pools**: Fees offset IL faster
4. **Consider weighted pools**: Reduce exposure to volatile assets

### Yield Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pool Hopping">
    Move liquidity to pools with highest BGT emissions (changes based on governance votes)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Range Optimization">
    For concentrated liquidity, adjust ranges based on price movements to stay in-range
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fee Tier Selection">
    Choose higher fee tiers for volatile pairs, lower for stable pairs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Liquidity Mining

Maximize BGT earnings by:

1. **Choosing high-weight pools**: Check which pools receive most BGT
2. **Staking LP tokens**: In governance-approved vaults
3. **Delegating BGT**: To validators who boost your pools

### Portfolio Approach

Diversify across multiple pools:

```
Conservative Portfolio:
- 60% Stablecoin pools (HONEY/USDC)
- 30% Major pairs (BERA/ETH)
- 10% High-yield volatile pairs

Aggressive Portfolio:
- 20% Stablecoin pools
- 40% Major pairs
- 40% High-yield volatile pairs
```

## Managing Your Liquidity

### Adding More Liquidity

You can add more liquidity anytime:
- No fees for adding
- Receive proportional LP tokens
- Automatically starts earning

### Removing Liquidity

To withdraw your funds:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Pool">
    Go to your pool position in the "Portfolio" section
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Amount">
    Choose how much to withdraw (25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the transaction and receive your tokens back plus accumulated fees
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Removing liquidity doesn't automatically claim your BGT rewards. Make sure to claim them separately!
</Warning>

## Analytics and Monitoring

Track your LP performance:

| Metric | Description | Where to Find |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| APR | Annual percentage return | Pool page |
| Daily Volume | Trading volume in pool | Analytics dashboard |
| TVL | Total value locked | Pool page |
| Your Share | % of pool you own | Portfolio |
| Fees Earned | Accumulated trading fees | Portfolio |
| BGT Earned | Accumulated BGT rewards | Rewards page |

## Safety & Best Practices

<Check>**Verify pool addresses**: Make sure you're depositing in official pools</Check>
<Check>**Start small**: Test with small amounts before committing large capital</Check>
<Check>**Diversify**: Don't put all liquidity in one pool</Check>
<Check>**Monitor regularly**: Check pool health and adjust as needed</Check>
<Check>**Understand risks**: Be aware of impermanent loss and smart contract risks</Check>
