## Understanding Trade Parameters

### Price Impact

Price impact shows how much your trade will move the market price:

<Check>**< 1%** - Low impact, good trade</Check>
<Warning>**1-3%** - Moderate impact, acceptable for larger trades</Warning>
<Warning>**> 3%** - High impact, consider splitting into smaller trades</Warning>

### Slippage Tolerance

Slippage tolerance is the maximum price difference you're willing to accept:

```
Recommended Settings:
- Stablecoins: 0.1% - 0.5%
- Major pairs: 0.5% - 1%
- Volatile pairs: 2% - 5%
```

<Note>
  Setting slippage too low may cause your transaction to fail. Setting it too high may result in unfavorable prices.
</Note>

### Transaction Deadline

Set a time limit for your transaction to be included in a block:

- **Default**: 20 minutes
- **Fast trades**: 5 minutes
- **Patient trades**: 30+ minutes

## Advanced Trading Features

### Limit Orders

Place limit orders to trade at specific prices:

```javascript
// Example: Buy 100 HONEY when price reaches 1 BERA
{
  tokenIn: "BERA",
  tokenOut: "HONEY",
  amountIn: 100,
  limitPrice: 1.0,
  expiry: timestamp + 86400 // 24 hours
}
```

<Note>
  Limit orders are executed by keepers when your target price is reached.
</Note>

### Multi-Hop Swaps

BEX automatically routes through multiple pools for best prices:

```
BERA → wETH → USDC
(Instead of direct BERA → USDC)
```

The interface shows you the route and splits:
- 70% through BERA/wETH → wETH/USDC
- 30% through BERA/HONEY → HONEY/USDC

### DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)

Set up recurring trades to average your entry price:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Example DCA Setup
{
  tokenIn: "BERA",
  tokenOut: "wBTC",
  amountPerTrade: 10, // 10 BERA per trade
  frequency: 86400, // Daily (in seconds)
  totalTrades: 30, // 30 trades total
}
```

</CodeGroup>
