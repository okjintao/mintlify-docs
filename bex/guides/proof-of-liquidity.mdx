# Proof of Liquidity

Proof of liquidity (PoL) is a mechanism that rewards users for their liquidity contributions to the Berachain ecosystem through native chain rewards, `$BGT`. As the native dApp powering trading liquidity in the Berachain ecosystem, a number of BEX pools will be eligible for `$BGT` rewards.

## Earning $BGT

The process for earning `$BGT` through BEX involves three simple steps:

1. **Provide Liquidity**: First, deposit liquidity into your chosen BEX pool

2. **Stake LP Tokens in Reward Vault**: After providing liquidity, you'll receive LP tokens. Stake these tokens in the pool's staking contract

You can view and manage your staked positions in the reward vaults here: [https://hub.berachain.com/vaults](https://hub.berachain.com/vaults)

## Whitelisting Pools for PoL Rewards

If you are a project that uses BEX for your tokens' liquidity, you can apply to have your pool(s) whitelisted for `$BGT` rewards. This process is conducted through Berachain governance, requiring a proposal to be submitted and voted on by `$BGT` holders.
